# Example Layout with Flexbox

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run sass-debug` or `npm run sass-build`

This watches the `src` folder and converts any SASS file(s) to compiled CSS. When using debug a source map is included. When using build all styles are compressed.

NOTE: after adding a new SASS file you will have to restart the watcher.

### `ctrl + shift + b`

Builds and watches for changes to TypeScript files.

Install this globally with npm i -g typescript
